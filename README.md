Exercise 2 - Rock Paper Scissors
Display 3 images, for "Rock", "Paper" and "Scissors".

Display a score board. Player and Computer start at 0.

Display a button to reset the game. This should set both players to score 0.

When clicking on the one of the images, your application should pick one of the 3 choices as well, at random.

Increment the score by 1 to the winner. Either use an alert or display a message about who won.

Once one of the players reaches 5 points, display a message about who won.

We will go over this exercise on Class 3, and we will discuss good strategies in composing Components, good React practices, proper use of props, state and event handlers.
